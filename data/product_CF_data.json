IFCO RPCs are made in different standard sizes covering a range of fruit and vegetable produce applications. IFCOâs RPC types are mutually compatible (i.e., in terms of stacking properties) for segregated and mixed dispatch units and suited to the use of jawed loaders as well as materials handling technology and automatic storage systems. Definition of functional unit: products are compared on the basis of providing the same defined function or unit of service which is called the functional unit. The function of produce containers is to transport fresh produce from growers to retail locations. In the case of the RPCs and DRCs, the containers can also be used to display the produce at retail stores. The functional unit of this LCA is based on an equivalent quantity of produce delivered to stores: 1,000 tonnes of produce delivered to retail stores in North America (US or Canada).",
